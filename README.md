# Telephone Central Simulation

Simulates a telephone network with cabins labeled `A–Z` (uppercase) and `a–z` (lowercase), supporting private and conference calls, call management, and system monitoring.

## Cabins
- **Central A** → cabins `A–Z`
- **Central B** → cabins `a–z`

## Making Calls

Use `dial` with caller and receiver:

```bash
dial
A
a
# CONNECTED → [Aa]
